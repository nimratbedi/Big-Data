
For building from command line:
Use the Given Source code and build.sbt file to create a project and follow the steps
 1.Go to project root directory in command prompt and build by following commands
    >sbt
 2.After sbt 
    > assembly
This will create a fat jar file containing all the dependencies.


To run the Spark Project from command line:

1.To start Zookeeper go into Kafka root directory
	bin\windows\zookeeper-server-start.bat config\zookeeper.properties

2.To start Kafka server go into Kafka root directory 
	bin\windows\kafka-server-start.bat config\server.properties

3.Create a Topic by using step a , which will be named "according to your choice" like here we used "India". After this, use the producer utility to generate messages on created topic 
   using step b
	(Note: It is desirable to use name of the topic that was already configured in your logstash conf file)
	a. bin\windows\kafka-topics.bat --create --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic "Created Topic name"
	b. bin\windows\kafka-console-producer.bat --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic "Created Topic name"

4.Start the consumer using below command and created topic name.(you can remove --from-beginning if old streaming results are unnecessary)
	bin\windows\kafka-console-consumer.bat --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic "Created Topic name" --from-beginning

5.Execute the SentimentAnalysis class by spark-submit with exceutable jar file path, created topic name as one argument and keyword we need to search as another argument, we can also give multiple key words with spaces
	spark-submit --packages org.apache.spark:spark-sql-kafka-0-10_2.11:2.4.0 --class SentimentAnalysis ".\xxx\xxx\SentimentAnalysis-assembly-0.1.jar" "Created Topic name" "Keywords to Search"

6.Go to Elasticsearch bin folder and run the following file
	elasticsearch.bat

7.Go to Kibana bin folder and run the following file
	kibana.bat

8.Go to logstsh root directory and execute the below command
	bin\logstash -f ".\xxx\xxx\Logstash-conffile.conf"   
	(In Quotes Path to logstash conf file with extension .conf and it should have topic name created earlier)

9.Now You can be able to go to http://localhost:5601 and use Kibana to visualize the data in real-time. You will have to search for the appropriate 
  topic index to create the index pattern,which is the topic index in the logstash config file. You can use multiple timeline filters and individual 
  Sentiment filters for the analysis.



bin\windows\kafka-topics.bat --create --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic "India"
bin\windows\kafka-console-producer.bat --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic India
bin\windows\kafka-console-consumer.bat --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic "" --from-beginning


bin\logstash -f  .\config\logstash-sample.conf
